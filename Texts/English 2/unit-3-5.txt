Andrea del Verrocchio

Andrea del Verrocchio (c. 1435-1488) was born in Florence in or about 1435. His father was Michele di Francesco Cioni, who worked as a tile and brick maker and later as a tax collector. Verrocchio never married and had to provide financial support for some members of his family. He was initially apprenticed to a goldsmith.

He was an Italian sculptor, goldsmith, and painter who worked at the court of Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence during the early Renaissance. Few paintings are attributed to him with certainty, but a number of important painters were trained at his workshop. His pupils included Leonardo da Vinci, Pietro Perugino, and Lorenzo di Credi. His greatest importance was as a sculptor, and his last work, the equestrian statue of Bartolomeo Colleoni in Venice, is universally accepted as a masterpiece.

A small painting on panel of Tobias (Tobias and the angel) setting out on his journey with the Archangel Raphael, carrying the fish with which he was to heal his father's blindness, was probably painted as a private devotional picture. It is now in London at the National Gallery. The Baptism of Christ, now in the Uffizi at Florence, was painted in 1474-75. In this work, Verrocchio was assisted by Leonardo da Vinci, then a youth and a member of his workshop, who painted the angel on the left and the part of the background above. Andrea resolved never to touch the brush again because Leonardo, his pupil, had far surpassed him. The Madonna enthroned with John the Baptist and St Donato is in the Cathedral at Pistoia. It had been left unfinished and was completed by Lorenzo di Credi when Verrocchio was in Venice near the end of his life. He died in Venice in 1488.

Verrocchio was a Florentine sculptor and painter who is ranked second only to Donatello among the Italian sculptors of the Renaissance. He set an example for other Renaissance sculptors to follow, which brought many new artists into the world.
