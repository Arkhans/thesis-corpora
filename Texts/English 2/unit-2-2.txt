Misganaw Worknehe, Ethiopia: "All tomorrows are the same" is an excerpt from "Tilting Cages: An Anthology of Refugee Writings," edited by Naomi Flutter and Carl Solomon.

Kakuma is located in the Turkana district, in the northwestern part of Kenya, bordering Ethiopia, Uganda, and Sudan. The area where the refugee camp is situated is dry, dusty, and sunny, with intense heat and dust particles in the air.

At the far end of the refugee camp stands a solitary plastic makeshift hut, seemingly detached from the world. Its owner, Mesfin, lives alone in this unfamiliar land. The shabby shelter provides partial protection from the sun and sand, but Mesfin feels undeserving of it, despite calling it his home.

When Mesfin experiences the stress of loneliness, lack of love, and hunger, he often wanders in the forest. In times of firewood shortage, which is frequent, he walks around twenty kilometers to collect twigs. Firewood is essential for cooking the hard-to-cook beans and is a major part of Mesfin's daily routine. Buying charcoal is not an option due to the scarcity of money, and collecting wood from around the camp is illegal and would lead to conflicts with the local Turkana people. Having a piece of wood becomes the difference between having a meal or going hungry. Therefore, Mesfin rises early with the sun to search for firewood.

Once, Mesfin nearly lost his life while carrying a bundle of firewood. He had ventured far from the camp to collect fallen trees and branches. After tying them together with a rope, he began his journey back under the scorching sun and burning sand. Exhausted and sweating, he encountered an aggressive local Turkana armed with knives and arrows. The Turkana demanded that Mesfin throw down the bundle he was carrying. Despite Mesfin's attempts to reason and show submissiveness, the Turkana remained uncompromising. Feeling defeated, Mesfin abandoned the wood and continued his journey back home, moving as if lifeless and cursing his unfortunate circumstances.

Arriving home, Mesfin collapsed on his mat, forgetting his hunger and empty stomach. He curled up, crying for peace, questioning the appropriateness of crying at his age, but finding it necessary to preserve his sanity.

When reflecting on his life and the experiences he has endured, Mesfin often ends up feeling confused. He initially fled his home country when the Marxist junta took power, but his return to Ethiopia and subsequent departures to Kenya revealed a cycle of turmoil. Mesfin acknowledges that he is prone to running away from problems, like a rabbit, without gaining any wisdom from his actions. However, his lengthy experience as a refugee has taught him the importance of tolerance for maintaining sanity and survival. He has witnessed friends perish or go mad, disappearing into the desert, their fates unknown.

While sitting and reminiscing, Mesfin reluctantly tolerates the behavior of police officers who treat refugees as if they own the world and the workers from humanitarian organizations who believe they understand the needs of refugees. He endures hunger, thirst, cold, and the relentless sun, despite their unbearable nature.

As he sits, he prays for deliverance, although he perceives God as unfair in his treatment of individuals. Mesfin questions the fairness of allowing some creatures to suffer in a hot desert, in an alien land, while others lead luxurious lives. Doubts about fairness arise within him.

Finally, exhausted, Mesfin goes to sleep, awaiting another tomorrow. In a refugee's life, all tomorrows are the sameâ€”no stories to tell, no history to write, and no future to plan. Tomorrow is simply another miserable day.
