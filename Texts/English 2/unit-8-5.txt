"The Sunken Library"

When you walk across Bebelplatz in Berlin’s Mitte district, it's common to notice people standing still, staring at a particular spot on the ground. As you approach, you observe a glass plate embedded in the paving stones. Beneath it, an underground room with empty bookshelves becomes visible. This memorial highlights what is missing: a room underground, nearly invisible, with no books, just empty white shelves, situated directly under Bebelplatz. The loss signifies the burning of the books by those who were ostracized and persecuted by the Nazis, individuals who were forced to leave the country and whose stories were forbidden to be told. On May 10, 1933, Nazi students burnt the works of hundreds of independent authors, journalists, philosophers, and academics in the middle of this square.

The Memorial

The memorial, titled “Library”, lies between the State Opera, St Hedwig's Cathedral, and buildings of the Humboldt University. It was conceptualized by Israeli artist Micha Ullman. The initiative to construct a memorial commemorating the book burnings arose in the Berlin Senate shortly after German reunification. The memorial consists of a two-by-two-meter underground space on Bebelplatz, visible through a glass top. The walls are painted white, with empty bookshelves symbolizing the cultural loss incurred by the National Socialist dictatorship.

Symbolically, the underground bookshelves have space for around 20,000 books, serving as a reminder of the approximately 20,000 books that were consumed by flames on May 10, 1933, at the instigation of the Nazis. The library memorial was unveiled on March 20, 1995.

Also embedded in the ground are two bronze plates that provide information and an inscription bearing a cautionary quote from Heinrich Heine, dated 1820:

"That was but a prelude;
where they burn books,
they will ultimately burn people as well."
