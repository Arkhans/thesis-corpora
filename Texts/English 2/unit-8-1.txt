"The Book Thief" is a 2013 World War II drama film directed by Brian Percival and features actors Geoffrey Rush, Emily Watson, and Sophie NÃ©lisse. The film, based on Markus Zusak's 2005 novel of the same title, was adapted for the screen by Michael Petroni. It tells the story of a young girl who lives with her adoptive German family during the Nazi era. Guided by her compassionate foster father, the girl starts "borrowing" books and sharing them with a Jewish refugee being sheltered in their home. The film's music was composed by Oscar-winning composer John Williams.

In the plot, the voice of Death narrates how a young girl, Liesel Meminger, has intrigued him. Liesel, traveling with her mother and younger brother on a train in February 1938, experiences her brother's death. After the burial, she steals her first book, "The Gravedigger's Handbook," which accidentally falls out of the gravedigger's pocket. Following her arrival in Munich, she meets her new foster parents, Rosa and Hans Hubermann, and Rudy Steiner, a neighborhood boy who becomes her school companion.

Liesel is challenged by schoolmate Franz Deutscher to read a word after revealing her illiteracy. She responds by assaulting him, which impresses Rudy, and they soon become best friends. Hans, her foster father, then teaches Liesel to read using the book she took from the graveside. Liesel is then drawn into reading anything she can find. 

The story intensifies as Liesel and Rudy join the Hitler Youth movement. Liesel is saddened to see books burned at a Nazi book burning ceremony, and when left alone, she takes a book that survived the fire, watched by Ilsa Hermann, the mayor's wife. Ilsa, who later catches Liesel taking a book, kindly offers her access to her library. The mayor, however, puts a stop to these visits and fires Rosa as their laundress.

During "Kristallnacht" (Night of Broken Glass), Max Vandenburg, a Jewish man whose father saved Hans in World War I, is taken in by the Hubermanns after his mother's insistence that he escapes. Liesel and Max bond over their shared hatred of Hitler and during this time, Liesel reads books "borrowed" from the mayor's library to an ill Max.

Liesel's secret of hiding Max is discovered by Rudy, who pledges to keep it secret. However, Rudy is forced to throw Max's journal into a river to keep it away from Franz, who overhears their conversation. Rudy retrieves the journal from the river, solidifying Liesel's trust in him.

The story takes a turn when Hans intervenes as a Jewish neighbor is taken away by police. His action draws attention to his family, forcing Max to leave. Hans is then drafted into the army. Later, Liesel spots Max among Jews being forcibly marched through town. Her attempts to reach him are thwarted by German soldiers and Rosa.

Their city is mistakenly bombed, killing Hans, Rosa, and Rudy's family. Liesel, who was in the basement writing, survives. In the aftermath, Liesel finds a book in the rubble and is comforted by Ilsa. 

After Germany's fall to the Allies, Liesel works in Rudy's father's tailor shop. Max, who survived, returns, and they have a joyful reunion. The final scene, narrated by Death, reveals Liesel's life until her death at age 90. She lived a full life, had a family, and it's suggested that she became a writer.
