Many young people are at risk of premature hearing loss, according to the Royal National Institute for Deaf People. In a report published today, it blames the growth in the popularity of loud music for what it says is an alarming rise in deafness among the young.

"These trends in youth culture have generated an inexorable rise in noise exposure and pose a serious threat to the hearing of an entire generation," the report says. It adds that a generation could experience hearing loss in middle age, rather than later on.

The report says that three times as many young people are exposed to dangerous sound levels today as in the early 1980s, with more than 23 percent now regularly listening to very loud music. Digital technology means that music can be played at events or on hi-fi systems at a much higher volume without being distorted. As a result, clubbers or those who listen to loud music at home are three times as likely to suffer from tinnitus, commonly referred to as noises in the head or ear. The noise may be whistling, ringing, or clicking; it may be constant or intermittent.

Hearing loss is cumulative, so regular attendance at live concerts and nightclubs puts people at increasing risk, especially if they also spend a lot of time listening to personal stereos. Although workers are required by law to be offered ear protection if they are subject to noise above 85 decibels, there are no statutory limits for the protection of audiences. At concerts, groups may play music amplified to above 120 decibels, which is 1,000 percent louder than 85 decibels.

A study in Britain found that of those who went to rock concerts, up to 73 percent reported dulled hearing or tinnitus or both. Among clubbers, the figure was 66 percent, and 17 percent of stereo users also reported hearing difficulties. Tests have shown that 44 percent of those who attend rock concerts once a month have hearing difficulties.
