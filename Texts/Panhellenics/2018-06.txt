Scientists have proposed a new way of looking out for marks of aliens in the universe. And it could help us see life forms we'd completely miss otherwise. Space agencies including NASA have been active in launching new tools to study the universe, such as the James Webb Telescope. That will provide information on the atmospheric makeup of planets far away - but we might not be sure how to use that information.

Until now, scientists have mostly been looking for oxygen in the atmosphere. If that's found, then it's likely that there's the chance for life on that planet since we know from life on Earth that oxygen is key.

But we might be missing other important markers (also known as biosignatures) that could indicate such worlds are supporting life. As such, planets might have life on them that we wouldn't spot using just oxygen.

"This idea of looking for atmospheric oxygen as a biosignature has been around for a long time. And it's a good strategy - it's very hard to make much oxygen without life," said Joshua Krissansen-Totton, an author of the paper published in Science Advances. "But we don't want to put all our eggs in one basket. Even if life is common in the cosmos, we have no idea if it will be life that makes oxygen. The biochemistry of oxygen production is very complex and could be quite rare."

To do the research, the scientists looked at the history of life on Earth and the kinds of gases that were around when life first appeared. They found that the planet had a complex mix of different gases, not only oxygen, and that looking for that cocktail could be a far more reliable marker of life on a planet.

"Our study shows that this combination would be a compelling sign of life. What's exciting is that it is also all doable and may lead to the historic discovery of an extraterrestrial biosphere in the not-too-distant future," said co-author David Catling, professor of Earth and Space Sciences.
