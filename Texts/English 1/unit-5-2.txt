Farm Animals Need Our Help

In polling, 94% of Americans agree that animals raised for food deserve to live free from abuse and cruelty. Yet the majority of the nearly 10 billion farm animals raised each year in the U.S. suffer in conditions that consumers would not accept if they could see them. Most of our meat, milk, and eggs come from industrial farms where efficiency trumps welfare—and animals are paying the price.

Factory Farms

A factory farm is a large, industrial operation that raises large numbers of animals for food. Over 99% of farm animals in the U.S. are raised in factory farms, which focus on profit and efficiency at the expense of animal welfare.

Chickens

The United States raises and slaughters almost 10 times more birds than any other type of animal. Approximately 8.5 billion chickens are killed for their meat every year, while another 300 million chickens are used in egg production. All birds—egg-laying hens, meat chickens, turkeys, ducks, geese, and others—are excluded from all federal animal protection laws. By the numbers, these are the animals most urgently in need of protection. The ASPCA is focused on raising public awareness about the plight of chickens raised for meat and is working actively with companies that buy or raise chickens toward the adoption of better practices.

Many people do not realize that the breed of chicken used for modern egg production is different from the breed used for meat production. If you put them next to each other, they look almost nothing alike! Each has been strategically bred for hyperproduction: egg-laying hens for high egg volume, and "meat" chickens for maximum breast meat. Both types suffer from severe physical problems brought on by genetic manipulation...
